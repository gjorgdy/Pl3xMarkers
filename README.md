## FAQ
### Q: The layers are not showing up on my web map, what do I do?
A: You most likely use custom names for your worlds. Make sure they use the correct suffix structure: ``{worldname}``, ``{worldname}_nether``, ``{worldname}_the_end``
### Q: Why are some points not showing up?
A: Areas are made out of the outermost points. If you have points inside the area they will not be used. Or the points are too far apart from the center.
### Q: Can I customize area labels?
A: Yes! Area names support basic HTML tags such as `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, `<br>`, and `<span style="color: #RRGGBB;"> mooi ding </span>`.
### Q: Why is my area a small triangle?
A: You either have too few points (minimum 3) or your points are too far apart.
### Q: How to reload the config?
A: Pl3xMarkers listens to Pl3xMap's reload, so you can reload using `/pl3xmap reload`

## Demo

The Pl3xMarkers mod started out as Helix Markers, for my server; [Helix Survival](https://play.hexasis.eu/)

You can check its webmap at [https://map.hexasis.eu/](https://map.hexasis.eu/?world=minecraft-overworld&renderer=vintage_story&zoom=2&x=842&z=1412)

## !! Warning !!

Pl3xMarkers is still an experimental mod, while there are no risks to your world by using it. You might have to reset your markers when updating the mod.

For portals and beacons this just means they should be used and activated. Where for areas you need to replace the banners to re-register the points.
